*NETWORK #1*

today we are going to learn about requests module in python and urllib
in order to get information from web-sites


we are going to solve:

0- Write a Python script that fetches https://intranet.hbtn.io/status

You must use the package urllib
You are not allowed to import any packages other than urllib
The body of the response must be displayed like the following example (tabulation before -)
You must use a with statement

Body response:$
    - type: <class 'bytes'>$
    - content: b'OK'$
    - utf8 content: OK$

1- Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL and displays the value of the X-Request-Id variable found in the header of the response.

You must use the packages urllib and sys
You are not allow to import packages other than urllib and sys
The value of this variable is different for each request
You don’t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
You must use a with statement
@ubuntu:~/0x11$ ./1-hbtn_header.py https://intranet.hbtn.io

@ubuntu:~/0x11$ ./1-hbtn_header.py https://intranet.hbtn.io

2-Write a Python script that takes in a URL and an email, sends a POST request to the passed URL with the email as a parameter, and displays the body of the response (decoded in utf-8)

The email must be sent in the email variable
You must use the packages urllib and sys
You are not allowed to import packages other than urllib and sys
You don’t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
You must use the with statement
Please test your script in the container provided, using the web server running on port 5000


3- Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL and displays the body of the response (decoded in utf-8).

You must use the package requests
You are not allow to import packages other than requests

5- Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL and displays the value of the variable X-Request-Id in the response header

You must use the packages requests and sys

The value of this variable is different for each request
You don’t need to check script arguments (number and type)


6- Write a Python script that takes in a URL and an email address, sends a POST request to the passed URL with the email as a parameter, and finally displays the body of the response.

The email must be sent in the variable email
You must use the packages requests and sys
You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys
You don’t need to error check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
Please test your script in the container provided, using the web server running on port 5000


7- Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL and displays the body of the response.

If the HTTP status code is greater than or equal to 400, print: Error code: followed by the value of the HTTP status code
You must use the packages requests and sys
You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys
You don’t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
Please test your script in the container provided, using the web server running on port 5000


8- Write a Python script that takes in a letter and sends a POST request to http://0.0.0.0:5000/search_user with the letter as a parameter.

The letter must be sent in the variable q
If no argument is given, set q=""
If the response body is properly JSON formatted and not empty, display the id and name like this: [<id>] <name>
Otherwise:
Display Not a valid JSON is the JSON is invalid
Display No result is the JSON is empty
You must use the package requests and sys
You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys
Please test your script in the container provided, using the web server running on port 5000. All JSON 
generated by this server are random.


9- Write a Python script that takes in a string and sends a search request to the Star Wars API

Use the Star Wars API search people endpoint
Use the string argument as the search value of the request
The body response must be JSON and converted to a Python dictionary.
Display: Number of results: <count>
Display the name of each result (see example below)
You must use the packages requests and sys
You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys
You don’t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
You don’t need to manage the pagination


10- Write a Python script that takes your Github credentials (username and password) and uses the Github API to display your id

You must use Basic Authentication to access to your information
The first argument will be your username
The second argument will be your password
You must use the package requests and sys
You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys
You don’t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)


100- The Holberton School staff evaluates candidates applying for a back-end position with multiple technical challenges, like this one:

Please list 10 commits (from the most recent to oldest) of the repository “rails” by the user “rails”
You must use the Github API, here is the documentation https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/
Print all commits by: `<sha>: <author name>` (one by line)
Write a Python script that takes 2 arguments in order to solve this challenge.

The first argument will be the repository name
The second argument will be the owner name
You must use the packages requests and sys
You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys
You don’t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
Only 17% of applicants for a backend position at Holberton finished this task in less than 15 minutes.
